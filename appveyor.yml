# Shockolate AppVeyor configuration 
# YAML format reference: https://www.appveyor.com/docs/appveyor-yml/

# This determines the disk image AppVeyor uses while building
# Despite its name, this image actually contains all sorts of non-VC goodies
# See https://www.appveyor.com/docs/build-environment/ for all the details
image: Visual Studio 2015

# Tell build_windows.sh that we're building for AppVeyor
environment:
  APPVEYOR: TRUE

# Avoid rebuilding external dependencies (ie. SDL and SDL_mixer)
# Uncache build_ext if external deps change
cache:
#  - res/music.sf2
#  - build_ext  

# Actual build script..
# Step 1: Git has to reside in a path without spaces because the SDL build script is weird like that.
#         So we create a symlink to the real Git, remove it from PATH and add our own.
# Step 2: We need to use our own make.exe to build stuff, so we add that
# Step 3: Do the actual building
build_script:
  - mklink /D c:\git "C:\Program Files\Git"
  - set PATH=%PATH:C:\Program Files (x86)\Git\bin;=%
  - set PATH=c:\git\usr\bin;%PATH%;C:\mingw-w64\i686-6.3.0-posix-dwarf-rt_v5-rev1\mingw32\bin\
  - copy windows\make.exe \git\usr\bin
  - set CMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM=c:\git\usr\bin\make.exe
  - sh build_windows.sh
  - build.bat

# For now, we don't have any automatic tests to run
test: off

# Once building is done, we gather all the necessary DLL files and build our ZIP file.
