# Shockolate - Portable systemshock
============

1. Copy res folder of original systemshock to this directory
2. Shockolate depends on 32bit SDL2. Install 32-bit SDL2 and SDL2_mixer by running `./install_32bit_sdl.sh`.
Linux needs sudo for this script. Script compiles and installs both libraries under `/usr/local/`, so make sure you know what you are doing.
3. Run shockolate `./systemshock`
